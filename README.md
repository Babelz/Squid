# Squid

C# Realtime GUI System


SQUID is an SDK to create user interfaces for games and other 2D/3D realtime applications, using a Retained Mode system.
SQUID does not depend on a certain rendering engine, you can use it with any engine you like, on any platform that supports the .NET 2.0 framework.

- it's a GUI blackbox
- it's easy to integrate
- it is engine independent
- it does not manage textures or fonts, only integers and strings
- it doesnâ€™t draw anything, you do

All you need to do is to implement 1 interface, the ISquidRenderer.
